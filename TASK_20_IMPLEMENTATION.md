# Task 20 - API Integration and Data Synchronization

## Overview
Task 20 focuses on integrating the CMS backend with the e-commerce frontend, creating a unified data layer and API structure that allows both applications to work with the same product data, categories, and content.

## Objectives
1. **Shared Database Integration** - Connect e-commerce frontend to CMS database
2. **API Endpoint Unification** - Create shared API routes for both applications
3. **Data Synchronization** - Ensure real-time data consistency
4. **Product Management Integration** - Allow CMS to manage e-commerce products
5. **Category Synchronization** - Unified category management
6. **Media Asset Sharing** - Shared media library between applications

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Database Integration âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Configure e-commerce frontend to use CMS database
- [x] Update e-commerce data models to match CMS schema
- [x] Create data migration script for existing mock data

### Phase 2: API Unification âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Create shared API endpoints accessible by both applications
- [x] Implement CORS configuration for cross-application requests
- [x] Add fallback mechanisms for API reliability

### Phase 3: Product Synchronization âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Update e-commerce product fetching to use CMS APIs
- [x] Implement CMS API service with fallback to mock data
- [x] Add product detail API integration

### Phase 4: Category Management âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Synchronize category structures between applications
- [x] Update e-commerce filtering to use CMS categories
- [x] Implement category API with product counts

### Phase 5: Media Integration âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Share media assets between CMS and e-commerce
- [x] Update image URLs and paths for CMS media
- [x] Implement media URL generation in API service

### Phase 6: Testing and Validation ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
- [x] Test data consistency across applications
- [x] Validate API performance and reliability
- [x] Ensure proper error handling and fallbacks

## Technical Requirements
- PostgreSQL database shared between applications
- Prisma ORM for consistent data access
- Next.js API routes for backend services
- TypeScript for type safety across applications
- Proper error handling and logging

## Success Criteria
- E-commerce frontend displays products from CMS database
- Changes in CMS are immediately reflected in e-commerce site
- Both applications maintain consistent data models
- API performance meets requirements (< 200ms response time)
- Proper error handling and graceful degradation

## Status: IN PROGRESS
