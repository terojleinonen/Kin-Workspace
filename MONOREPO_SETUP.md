# Monorepo Setup Complete

## What Was Done

### 1. Project Restructuring
- Created a monorepo structure with separate folders for e-commerce and CMS
- Moved all existing e-commerce code to `kin-workspace/` folder
- Created a new CMS application in `cms/` folder
- Set up root orchestrator with concurrent script management

### 2. Root Configuration
- **package.json**: Root orchestrator with workspace management and concurrent scripts
- **README.md**: Updated documentation for monorepo structure
- **.gitignore**: Comprehensive gitignore for both projects
- **Scripts**: Added commands to run both projects simultaneously or individually

### 3. E-commerce Project (kin-workspace/)
- **Port**: 3000
- **Status**: Fully migrated with all existing functionality
- **Location**: `./kin-workspace/`
- All original files, tests, and configurations preserved

### 4. CMS Project (cms/)
- **Port**: 3001
- **Status**: Basic structure created with dashboard and products page
- **Location**: `./cms/`
- Ready for further development

## Available Commands

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm run install:all

# Development (both projects)
npm run dev

# Individual development
npm run dev:ecommerce  # Port 3000
npm run dev:cms        # Port 3001

# Production builds
npm run build
npm run start

# Testing and linting
npm run test
npm run lint
```

## Next Steps

1. **Start Development**: Run `npm run dev` to start both projects
2. **CMS Development**: Expand the CMS with product management, order processing, etc.
3. **API Integration**: Connect CMS to the same database as the e-commerce site
4. **Authentication**: Add admin authentication to the CMS
5. **Deployment**: Set up deployment pipelines for both projects

## Project URLs
- **E-commerce**: http://localhost:3000
- **CMS**: http://localhost:3001

The monorepo is now ready for development with both projects running concurrently!
